Simple USB logging program which automatically logs the information of the attached computer relatively platform independently. 
The project is written in Java and also contains a very lightweight .BAT file.

EDIT: Due to changes in windows, (which I hadn't researched properly), autorun.inf files are no longer working as intended, so the program can't run automatically, the program still works, how ever the user now manually has to launch the runnable jar file in order to register to the log.
I will non the less keep the project up here regardless, for future reference.
